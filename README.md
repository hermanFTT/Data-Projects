# Projects
Independent and class projects related to machine learning . Some of these projects involve deep learning concepts such as DNN, deep convolutional neural networks , Decoder (U-net, V-net), transfer learning, and RNN. Others focus on MCMC, variational autoencoder (VAE), denoising diffusion model, and Bayesian modeling.
